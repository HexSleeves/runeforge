# Core Modules

Runeforge's core functionality is split into several focused crates. These provide the fundamental types and utilities needed for almost any roguelike game.

- **[Color](crates/color.md)**: Color management, blending, and conversion.
- **[Geometry](crates/geometry.md)**: 2D primitives like points, rectangles, and circles.
- **[Random](crates/random.md)**: Random number generation and dice rolling.
- **[Direction](crates/direction.md)**: Grid movement and direction handling.
