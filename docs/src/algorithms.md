# Algorithms

Runeforge provides several common algorithms used in roguelike development.

- **[Field of View (FOV)](crates/fov.md)**: Calculate which tiles are visible to the player.
- **[Pathfinding](crates/pathfinding.md)**: Find the shortest path between two points (A*, Dijkstra).
- **[Map Generation](crates/algorithms.md)**: Algorithms for procedural dungeon generation.
- **[Noise](crates/noise.md)**: Procedural noise generation (Perlin, etc.).
